Why did you build this project? 
As I completed The Odin Project, I felt like I really couldn't understand some points of the course, so I went to Leetcode to practice and see what I missed out. There I learned a lot about algorithms and data. This project is going to help me see how much I've improved.

This readme was done before starting the project.
